Additional Information:

A Fibonacci number is a series of numbers in which each Fibonacci number is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. 
It means that the next number in the series is the addition of two previous numbers. Let the first two numbers in the series be taken as 0 and 1.
By adding 0 and 1, we get the third number as 1. Then by adding the second and the third number(i.e) 1 and 1, we get the fourth number as 2, and similarly, the process goes on. 
Thus, we get the Fibonacci series as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ……. Hence, the obtained series is called the Fibonacci number series.
